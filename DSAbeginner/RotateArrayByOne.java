// Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.

// Examples:

// Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
// Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.
// Input: arr = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
// Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
// Explanation: After rotating clock-wise 3 comes in first position.

Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.
Input: arr = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
Explanation: After rotating clock-wise 3 comes in first position.
